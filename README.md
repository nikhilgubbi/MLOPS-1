### What is Automated Machine Learning?
Automated machine learning (AutoML) represents a fundamental shift in the way organizations of all 
sizes approach machine learning and data science. Applying traditional machine learning methods to 
real-world business problems is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and challenging. It requires experts
in the several disciplines, including data scientists – some of the most sought-after professionals in the job market right now.

Automated machine learning changes that, making it easier to build and use machine learning models in the real 
world by running systematic processes on raw data and selecting models that pull the most relevant information 
from the data – what is often referred to as “the signal in the noise.” Automated machine learning incorporates
machine learning best practices from top-ranked data scientists to make data science more accessible across the organization.
